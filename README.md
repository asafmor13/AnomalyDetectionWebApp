# AnomalyDetectionWebApp
**Preview from AnomalyDetectionWebApp**

Our App (AnomalyDetectionWebApp) is made especially for pilots and flight researchers that want to explore flights.
The app is recieving a csv file without anomalies and a file that may contain some anomalies.
In one way we can click on 'upload' and the files are uploaded to the server, where an anomaly is detected and the output with the anomaly report appears on the same page and in the other way we can getting back JSON which includes a report of where the anomalies occurred.
